Prepare:
To set up your environment, you need to have:
- 1, Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- 2, Install [Qt](qt.io)
- 3, Download [VTK source codes](https://vtk.org/download/) and compile it.

How to build your VTK, you can refer [VTK/Configure and Build](https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Configure_and_Build)

The only thing that artical did not mention is:

Set the right path for Qt, it is not the QT_DIR in your environment, 

but it is: 

##Something like -- ...Qt5.13.2/5.13.2/clang_64/lib/cmake
